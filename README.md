 Porfolio assignment for DIG4639C - Mobile Development

Option 2: New Project, 3 components
Create ONE (1) new React Native project using React Native Elements and React Navigation (using Expo). It should include at least 3 screens and three new components that you author (not built-in components).

Remember, a screen is a set of components visible on the screen. A screen is not the same set of components with different values with a different file name.

Possibilities include the following, with approval required for other options:

Create an alternative design for a fully-functioning exercise app with one exercise per screen with a central screen from which a user can navigate.
This app must be substantially different than the one produced previously but may have similar features.
New components could include the workout plan previously designed (e.g. specific exercises in a sequence),  
Create a new study app or trivia app with new question types (other than multiple choice).
Each question type would be its own screen, with the score tallied at the end.
Examples for new question types would include text input (for math problems, for instance), drop down, matching, survey (e.g. a Likert scale for collecting opinions Links to an external site.). 
Each question type should be reflected in the data structure and have a way to evaluate whether it is correct or completed (survey)
Create a partial implementation of an e-commerce app, which might include a form for collecting info on selling an item (e.g. Amazon marketplace, or eBay) and mock up of sales listings. Think simple.
